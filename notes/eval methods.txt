feature extractors:
	-> vit
		-> patch-wise extraction
		-> whole image extraction
	-> CNN
		-> patch-wise extraction
		-> whole image extraction

distance-based evaluation (dictionary made from vit pretrained)
	-> euclidean
	-> cosine

regression-based evaluation (dictionary made from vit pretrained)
	-> SVM
	-> Logistic regression

MLP-classification-based evaluation
	-> trained on individual embeddings
	-> trained on runtime merged embeddings

threshold calculations
	->maybe save top 10 accuracies for further analysis later
