for all: save all predictions in order

1) vit on whole image
2) vit on patched image (4)
	->save per/patch prediction for each image
3) vit on patched image (16)
	-> save per/patch prediction for each image
4) cnn on whole image
5?) cnn on patched image (4) (if 2>3)
	->save per/patch prediction for each image
5?) vit on patched image (16) (if 3>2)
	-> save per/patch prediction for each image
6) embedding based whole image
7) embedding based patched image (4)
	-> if individual % > x?
8) embedding based patched image (16)
	-> if individual % > x?
